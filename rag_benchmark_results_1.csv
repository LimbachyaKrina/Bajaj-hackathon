Both state that the grace period for premium payment is 30 days. The wording is slightly different, but the meaning is identical, thus fully aligning with the expected answer.","The grace period is explicitly mentioned as 30 days in the provided text, which allows for the renewal of the policy without a break in coverage, although coverage is not available during the grace period.",chunk_93_pg(),87.38
After how long are pre-existing diseases covered?,Pre-existing diseases are covered after thirty-six (36) months of continuous coverage from the date of inception of the first policy.,Covered after 36 months of continuous coverage.,0.522,1.0,"The predicted answer aligns perfectly with the expected answer. Both state that pre-existing diseases are covered after 36 months of continuous coverage. The predicted answer provides additional detail by mentioning 'from the date of inception of the first policy,' but this does not contradict or alter the expected answer. Therefore, the predicted answer is fully accurate and complete in relation to the expected answer.","The relevant clause specifies that coverage for pre-existing diseases is provided after thirty-six months of continuous coverage, provided the disease was declared at the time of application and accepted by the insurer.",chunk_53_pg(),87.38
"Does this policy cover maternity expenses, and what are the eligibility conditions?","Yes, the policy covers maternity expenses, including medical treatment expenses traceable to childbirth and expenses towards lawful medical termination of pregnancy. Eligibility conditions include the female Insured Person being continuously covered for at least 24 months before availing this benefit, and being between 18 and 45 years of age.",The female Insured Person should have been continuously covered for at least 24 months before availing this benefit.,0.448,0.9,"The predicted answer aligns well with the expected answer by correctly stating that the female Insured Person must be continuously covered for at least 24 months before availing the maternity benefit. Additionally, the predicted answer provides extra relevant information about the policy covering maternity expenses and an age eligibility condition (18 to 45 years), which is not mentioned in the expected answer. This additional information does not contradict the expected answer but rather complements it. Therefore, the predicted answer is mostly accurate and complete, warranting a high score of 0.9.","The policy covers maternity expenses as defined, but imposes eligibility conditions such as a 24-month continuous coverage requirement and age restrictions for the insured female. These conditions are clearly outlined in the policy clauses.","chunk_35_pg, chunk_36_pg",87.38
What is the cataract surgery limit under Plan A?,"Up to 15% of Sum Insured (SI) or INR 60,000, whichever is lower, for each eye per insured person.","Up to 15% of SI or INR 60,000 whichever is lower.",0.671,0.9,"The predicted answer aligns closely with the expected answer, correctly stating the cataract surgery limit as 'Up to 15% of Sum Insured (SI) or INR 60,000, whichever is lower.' The additional detail 'for each eye per insured person' is not mentioned in the expected answer, but it does not contradict the expected answer. This additional information could be relevant and accurate, but since it was not specified in the expected answer, it slightly deviates from the expected response. Therefore, the score is slightly reduced to 0.9.","The limit for cataract surgery under Plan A is explicitly stated as up to 15% of the Sum Insured or INR 60,000, whichever is lower. This information is directly extracted from the relevant clauses.","chunk_130_pg(), chunk_122_pg(), chunk_129_pg()",87.38

It mentions that this is subject to specific conditions, which is a reasonable interpretation of the expected answer's requirement for compliance with the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994. However, the predicted answer does not explicitly mention the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, which is a specific condition noted in the expected answer. This omission slightly reduces the completeness of the response, but the core information is accurately conveyed.","The policy covers the medical expenses incurred for an organ donor's hospitalization during the policy period for harvesting the organ donated to an insured person, provided that the organ donation complies with the Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994, the organ is used for an insured person who has been medically advised to undergo an organ transplant, and the expenses are incurred as an in-patient in a hospital.

However, it lacks the specific detail that inpatient AYUSH treatment is covered up to the Sum Insured in AYUSH hospitals. This omission of details results in a slight deduction in the score.","The policy includes coverage for AYUSH treatment, specifically for inpatient care treatment under Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy systems of medicine. This is covered up to the limit of the Sum Insured as specified in the Policy Schedule in any AYUSH Hospital.","chunk_27_pg_5, chunk_27_pg_6",87.38

What is the waiting period for cataract surgery?,The waiting period for cataract surgery is two years.,Covered after a waiting period of two years.,0.619,1.0,"The predicted answer accurately reflects the expected answer by stating that the waiting period for cataract surgery is two years. Both answers convey the same information, with the predicted answer being a direct and clear restatement of the expected answer. Therefore, the predicted answer fully aligns with the expected answer.",The relevant clause specifies that cataract surgery is subject to a two-year waiting period.

How is No Claim Discount (NCD) calculated?,"A No Claim Discount (NCD) of flat 5% is allowed on the base premium upon renewal of policies with a term of one year, provided no claims are reported in the expiring policy. For policies with a term exceeding one year, the NCD amount for each claim-free policy year is aggregated and allowed on renewal, but the total NCD cannot exceed 5% of the total base premium for the policy term.",A 5% discount on the base premium is provided on renewal if no claims were made in the expiring policy term.,0.361,0.8,"The predicted answer aligns well with the expected answer in terms of the basic concept of a 5% discount on the base premium upon renewal if no claims were made. However, the predicted answer provides additional details about policies with terms exceeding one year, which are not mentioned in the expected answer. This additional information does not contradict the expected answer but expands on it, which may or may not be relevant depending on the context of the question. Therefore, the predicted answer is mostly correct but includes extra details that were not specified in the expected answer.","The relevant clause specifies that a flat 5% NCD is applied to the base premium for one-year policies if no claims are made. For multi-year policies, the NCD is aggregated for each claim-free year but capped at 5% of the total base premium.",chunk_51_pg(),87.38

These details are important for a complete understanding of the coverage conditions. Therefore, while the predicted answer is partially correct, it is not fully aligned with the expected answer.","Infertility treatments are covered if the policy has been continuously in force for 24 months from inception or from the date of inclusion of the insured person, whichever is later. Coverage is subject to limits shown in the Table of Benefits and excludes insured persons above 45 years of age, diagnostic tests, and certain other exclusions.

However, the predicted answer does not specify the amount of INR 500 per day, which is a key detail in the expected answer. Despite this omission, the core information about the duration and starting point of the benefit is accurately captured, warranting a high score but not a perfect one.",The relevant clause specifies that Hospital Cash is payable only from the 4th to the 8th day of hospitalisation.

However, the expected answer provides additional detail by specifying that coverage is provided for treatment at different stages, including AIDS.

However, it lacks the specific detail about the coverage limit of INR 5,000 per policy year and the condition of coverage without hospitalization.

However, it introduces additional information about outpatient dental treatments being covered, which is not mentioned in the expected answer. This additional information could potentially lead to confusion about the scope of coverage. Despite this, the core requirement of coverage due to injury is correctly addressed, warranting a high score but not a perfect one.","The policy covers outpatient dental treatments as specified in chunk_108_pg, with certain exclusions for cosmetic dental treatments as mentioned in chunk_109_pg.

However, it also introduces additional information about other plans (INR 2,00,000), which is not relevant to the specific question about Plan A. The expected answer is more precise and directly answers the question, while the predicted answer is broader and partially correct.
